# EGM703 - Week 2 Practical: Hyperspectral image analysis

## Overview
In the lectures and reading this week, you've learned about hyperspectral remote sensing and a number of different methods for analyzing hyperspectral data. In this practical, we'll gain some experience working with hyperspectral data, using a few examples written in python.

## Objectives

- Open and view data using xarray
- Perform atmospheric correction using dark object subtraction
- Use spectral angle matching to compare spectral signatures and identify surfaces
- Gain some familiarity with Spectral Python (SPy), a python package for analyzing hyperspectral images.

## Data provided
In the `data` folder, you should have the following files:

- solar_spectra.csv
- spectral_library.csv

You'll need to download the hyperspectral data from Blackboard, or from the Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EHJpSbkbARJ2Rt6NndBSPe9SlcYr_iO/view?usp=sharing) - be sure to save it to the `data` folder.

## Getting started

Once you clone the repository, you can set up the conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file.

To get started working through the practical, launch the jupyter notebook (`Hyperspectral Image Analysis.ipynb`).
